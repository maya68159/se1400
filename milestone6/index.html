                <h3>What is yoga?</h3>
                <p>Yoga is an anciet practice that originated in India. A lot of the practices were first written about in the ancient scriptural text "The Bhagavad Gita" which describes and lays out majority of the yogic principles that are praticed; interestingly, everything except the poses. The poses in yoga are called "asanas" and contrary to popular belief they are actually not the main focus of yoga. Though it may seem that way in western yoga classes, it is believed that the purpose of asanas is actually to move the body so that when you are still, you can more clealy enter and connect with your mind. Not only this, but there are so many differnet aspects of yoga that are practiced daily rather than just movements done in 60 min guided flow once a week.</p>

                <h3>Why I love yoga?</h3>
                <p>There are SO many reasons that I love yoga. My journey with yoga started with a need to move my body in a low impact, yet high reward, way as I have chronic pain. Yoga helped me fufill this need and I continued to find so much more. I love the philosophy of yoga and all the thought proccesses that have lead to such a beneficial practice. I love the history of yoga and the Sanskrit words and meanings of the poses. Everything about yoga can bring you more peace. Movement, flexibility, trusting yourself and the gound below you, meditation, and breath are all such simple yet profound practices that I genuinely believe make for a better and more peaceful life. Arguably the best part, is that whether you're the most felxible person you know or can barely touch your toes, almost any basic pose can be modified so that you can still access the physical benefits of moving and stretching your body. I hope you join me on this journey to love your mind and body a little more though yoga.</p>
