                    <p class="resourceInfo" >This has been an excelent source for me and actually the program I am working on to get my yoga teacher certification. They have so many competent and capable instructors that teach so well. Despite the challenges of it being an online course, I don't feel that there is a lack of proper instruction at all; which was totally a worry of mine. This 200 hour course digs deep into the history, philosophy, anatomy, and of course asanas of yoga. If an in person class is not available to you, this is an excellent option.</p>

It can be difficult to find time to be calm and still in the hustling life that is western culture. I think this book gives great insight on how to tend to the more spiriutal sides of ourselves yet still embrace the crazy of this life. Its an excellent read if that sounds like something you would like to learn more about.</p>
