            <p class="myinfo">I am a student in Utah and I am currently working on attaining my yoga teacher ceritification. I love to teach and I love yoga, so I really feel called to share and teach one of my many passions. Yoga helps my mental state so much and my physical health as well. I have two chronic pain conditions that need me to consistenly move my body but sometimes make it far from appealing. Yoga is a great practice for me because it is low impact yet allows me to move through my joints and stretch out my muscles safely. Not only safely, but also in a way I really enjoy. I emplore you to take a chance and go to that yoga class you've heard about or watch a video on YouTube if you feel called to do so. Obviously not every form of exercize is for everybody but my hoep is that yoga changes your life as much as it has changed mine.</p>
