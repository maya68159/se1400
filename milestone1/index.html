      <h2>Website Summary</h2>
      <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
      <p>
        My site will contian yogic and minful practices that I feel called to
        share throughout my yoga teacher training.
      </p>
      <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site?</h4>
      <p>
        Most of my content will come from things I am learning in my modules and
        classes as well as my own thoughts and meditation topics I come up with.
      </p>
      <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
      <p>
        I think users should care so they can decide if they feel called to join
        me in my journey.
      </p>
      <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
      <p>
        I think making more approachable entrences into yoga and mindfullness
        helps brings others to practices that have helped me so much.
      </p>
      <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
      <p>
        I would like users to join my jouney as I learn more about yoga and
        hopefully they can interact and learn as well as teach me a thing or
        two.
      </p>
      <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
      <p>
        I would hope that my sight would attract people that are either starting
        their own yoga journey and need information, attract students when I
        start teaching, and create community.
