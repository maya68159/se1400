      <h1>Audience</h1>
      <h2>Geolocation</h2>
      <p>
        I would hope my webiste would appeal to people from all over. I imagine
        that it would grasp more that are from the United States and English
        speaking as thats probably the location that would most understand my
        content.
      </p>
      <h2>Age</h2>
      <p>
        My site would probably attract users of ages similar to mine as thats
        the audience I, by default, communicate most effectively with.
      </p>
      <h2>Gender</h2>
      <p>
        I imagine I will attract more women than men users, but I intend to make
        a website that is welcoming and accessable to those of any gender or
        orientation.
      </p>
      <h5>
        Overall, I imagine my site will attract female users in locations
        similar to mine, that speak the same language as me, and around my same
        age. However, it is very important to me to put energy into creating a
        site that is welcoming to all, especially those that don't normally feel
        welcome in the yoga community and those with disabilities.
